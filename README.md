# number-guessing-game
A simple command-line Number Guessing Game built with Python. The game randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player must guess the number with feedback provided after each attempt. It's a great beginner project to practice basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and input handling.

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Take a guess: 50
Too high!
Take a guess: 25
Too low!
Take a guess: 34
Correct! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
